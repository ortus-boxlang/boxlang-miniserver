## Welcome to the BoxLang MiniServer Runtime

This BoxLang web server runtime is a minimal server powered by JBoss Undertow and the BoxLang language. It is designed to be a lightweight and fast server. It is perfect for serverless applications, microservices, and APIs.  If you want a more robust server, then you can use the [BoxLang CommandBox Server](https://boxlang.ortusbooks.com/getting-started/running-boxlang/commandbox).  You can find the full documentation here https://boxlang.ortusbooks.com/getting-started/running-boxlang/miniserver

### JSON Configuration Support

The MiniServer now supports loading configuration from a `miniserver.json` file, making it easier to manage server settings without typing long command-line arguments every time.

- **Automatic Loading**: Place a `miniserver.json` in your current directory and run `boxlang-miniserver` with no arguments
- **Explicit Path**: Run `boxlang-miniserver /path/to/config.json` to use a specific configuration file
- **CLI Override**: Command-line arguments always override JSON configuration
- **Documentation**: See [MINISERVER_JSON.md](MINISERVER_JSON.md) for complete details and examples

Example `miniserver.json`:
```json
{
  "port": 8080,
  "host": "0.0.0.0",
  "webRoot": "./www",
  "debug": true,
  "rewrites": true,
  "healthCheck": true
}
```

## What is BoxLang?

**BoxLang** is a modern dynamic JVM language that can be deployed on multiple runtimes: operating system (Windows/Mac/*nix/Embedded), web server, lambda, iOS, android, web assembly, and more. **BoxLang** combines many features from different programming languages, including Java, ColdFusion, Python, Ruby, Go, and PHP, to provide developers with a modern and expressive syntax.

**BoxLang** has been designed to be a highly adaptable and dynamic language to take advantage of all the modern features of the JVM and was designed with several goals in mind:

* Be a rapid application development (RAD) scripting language and middleware.
* Unstagnate the dynamic language ecosystem in Java.
* Be dynamic, modular, lightweight, and fast.
* Be 100% interoperable with Java.
* Be modern, functional, and fluent (Think mixing CFML, Node, Kotlin, Java, and Clojure)
* Be able to support multiple runtimes and deployment targets:
  * Native OS Binaries (CLI Tooling, compilers, etc.)
  * MiniServer
  * Servlet Containers - CommandBox/Tomcat/Jetty/JBoss
  * JSR223 Scripting Engines
  * AWS Lambda
  * Microsoft Azure Functions (Coming Soon)
  * Android/iOS Devices (Coming Soon)
  * Web assembly (Coming Soon)
* Compile down to Java ByteCode
* Allow backward compatibility with the existing ColdFusion/CFML language.
* Great IDE, Debugger and Tooling: https://boxlang.ortusbooks.com/getting-started/ide-tooling
* Scripting (Any OS and Shebang) and REPL capabilities
